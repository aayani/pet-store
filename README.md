# Pet Store

A sample micro-services project built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Docker](https://docker.com) for managing a pet store

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project on your system, make sure you have the following software installed.

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - fast and reliable dependency management
- [docker](https://docker.com) - OS level virtualization to deliver packages called containers
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) - tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications

### Installing

To get the project up and running, navigate to the root directory of the project.

To initialize the pets service, provide these commands in the terminal

```
cd pets
\yarn
\yarn build
```

And to initialize the owners service

```
cd owners
\yarn
\yarn build
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
